<p>Knock on wood, I've fortunately never had to restore from backup.<br>My question is not about how to do it, but rather, is about what the restore would look like.<br>My basic understanding is that deja dup backs up your files, and timeshift backs up your system settings.<br>Thus, if you, let's say, completely wiped your system and reinstalled, then restored from deja dup and timeshift, would your system look basically like what it was before wiping, but without your installed applications?Then do a restore right now.You do not want to learn how to do a restore when you have just lost your data, regardless of your backup solution.<br>Especially because the time when you learn how to do a restore is also the time when you learn what you forgot to include in the backup.Timeshift by default take a snapshot of system files.<br>So restoring from timeshift should also restore app installed from Deb/RPM package without user settings.I haven't used deja dup.<br>I backup .config, .local or  subdirectory of .local (mainly share folder).<br>You can use rsync(grsync GUI) or tar.gz or tar.xz for that.Lately, I have been using flatpak heavily for most apps.<br>So I just backup /var/lib/flatpak, ~/.var/apps and ~/.local/share/flatpak.<br>I use rsync (or grsync GUI) for incremental backup.<br>Then make a fsarchiver archive monthly from /var/lib/flatpak and delete it after a new fsarchiver archive is created.You can make a filesystem archive using fsarchiver also.<br>You can take a backup of your home partition or folder.<br>There are numerous ways to achieve this.ThanksDeja Dup has a restore pane in the app.<br> It looks like a file browser, and it has a drop-down with the date of the backup.<br> You just select the file or files to restore and it churns through duplicity incremental to restore them to where you tell it.Thanks, like I said, I wasn't so worried about how to do it, rather, I was curious if my assumption that timeshift plus deja dup would restore my entire system was correct.Timeshift will backup everything if you select all on the home screen in the setup wizard.<br> Also, you should keep your Linux backup on another drive.<br> If your Linux drive ever fails and your backup is on that drive, you will be without a backup.MembersOnlineKnock on wood, I've fortunately never had to restore from backup.<br>My question is not about

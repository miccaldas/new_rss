<p>Over the past year, we’ve been trialling a beta of Raspberry Pi OS in glorious 64-bit.<br>Now it’s time to open it up to a wider audience.The ARMv8-A architecture, which encompasses the 64-bit AArch64 architecture and associated A64 instruction set, was first introduced into the Raspberry Pi line with Raspberry Pi 3 in 2016.<br>From that point on, it has been possible to run a full 64-bit operating system on our flagship products, and many third-party operating systems are available.<br>However, we have continued to build our Raspberry Pi OS releases on the 32-bit Raspbian platform, aiming to maximise compatibility between devices and to avoid customer confusion.As you can see from the table above, it is easy to be confused about which products will support which Debian/Raspbian ports.<br>Using arm6hf (Raspbian’s derivative of armhf with ARMv7-only instructions removed but floating-point instructions retained) provides us with an operating system which will run on every device we have ever manufactured, all the way back to 2011.But we’ve come to realise that there are reasons to choose a 64-bit operating system over a 32-bit one.<br>Compatibility is a key concern: many closed-source applications are only available for arm64, and open-source ones aren’t fully optimised for the armhf port.<br>Beyond that there are some performance benefits intrinsic to the A64 instruction set: today, these are most visible in benchmarks, but the assumption is that these will feed through into real-world application performance in the future.A more theoretical concern is that 32-bit pointers only allow you to address 4GB of memory.<br>On Raspberry Pi 4, we use the ARM Large Physical Address Extension (LPAE) to access up to 8GB of memory, subject to the constraint that any process is limited to accessing 3GB (we reserve the top 1GB of the virtual address space for the kernel).<br>Very few processes require more memory than this: happily Chromium, which is probably the most memory-intensive application in Raspberry Pi OS, spawns a process per tab.<br>But some use cases will benefit from being able to allocate the entire memory of an 8GB Raspberry Pi 4 from a single process.The 64-bit version of Chromium, installed by default, has no version of the WidevineCDM library and therefore, it is not possible to play streaming media such as Netflix or Disney+.  To instead choose the 32-bit version just do the following within a terminal window:To return to the 64-bit versionSo, head to the  and grab your copy of 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS today.<br>Let us know in the comments if your use case benefits (or suffers!) from the move to 64-bit.Thank you! My use case is __uint128_t which is not available on 32-bit systems so yes, I’ll benefit.Woah! That’s a big announcement.<br>I’m so happy that Pi OS 64 bit is now officialIt’s  based on your own repo or just debian repo like before?? There isn’t enough  info for such announcements…The upstream of the 32bit OS is Raspbian (which is just a rebuild of Debian for ARM6 with hard float extensions).<br> The upstream of the 64bit OS is Debian.But both of them have our own sprinkled magic to make it Raspberry Pi OS.Including hardware accelerationExcellent work!
How does the video decoding work? Does it use the mmal decoder like the 32bit?No, we don’t use the MMAL interface anymore, we use V4L2 – stateless for Chromium and VLC.I’ve been using 64 but for a while, because Elasticsearch does not have a supported 32 bit version for ARM (though it can be forced to work if the components are unpacked and installed manually).<br>Also, I had at least one issue with 32 bit ints in PHP storing time stamps.Does the hardware acceleration work? The GitHub issue is still open.<br>Video acceleration works through Chromium and VLC, GPU acceleration works through Mesa, the same as it does on the 32bit hardwareYoutube will never work .
It falls back to cpu decoding
The drivers will never work with a web browser to ever get YouTube workingHmm.<br>I’m a dummy with all this but using twisteros YouTube streams fine with chromium and also the ap built in to twisteros.<br>I will look I guess for twisteros in 64 bit I home soon.On Chromium YouTube works fine, just tried playing some trailers in 1080p from youtube fullscreen and it’s good…Just want to congratulate you on the work you have done on Pi operating systems.<br>The effort on optimisation is very much appreciated.<br>I use the PiOS desktop on a very underpowered laptop and it is the best OS I have found (and I have tried alot) an especial “tip of the hat” goes to your extension of LXDE
Looking forward to install in 64 bit on my ZERO2 and PI4
Thanks again
dI’d suggest only the lite version on the Pi Zero 2, 512MB is very limiting for the 64bit desktop OSI’ve also been using 64-bit for a while and see significant performance improvements.<br> Use case is a SW codec for video streaming which heavily uses NEON intrinsics (the NewTek NDI SDK).Congratulations for this release !
I have been successfully testing the beta since the begining and it was already great.
Software support for the Pi is a valuable strength upon other SBC manufacturers, and this release is really a huge milestone.
Ironically, though, the Raspberry Pi OS released for celebrating the 10 years of the original Pi, can’t run on it ^^Hi, congrats on the release.<br>If I had the x64 beta from December.<br>What are the required steps to “update the os” to the stable one? I checked sources and sources.d and both are in bullseye.<br>Also updated the firmware and that just jumped the kernel to .94.<br>thanks in advancesudo apt update
sudo apt upgradeThis should get you to the same position assuming you started with the recent Bullseye release (in 64-bit)Can you install both 64 and 32 bit chromium and just switch between them? I’m sure you probably can, that  it’d require extra configuration after the install to work, and I have better things to do with my time than fight a computer to give it basic functionality….<br>At this point I’m still not seeing a reason to once again try switching to 64bit.<br>It was nothing less than a waste of time last I tried a few months ago, all I got out of it was anger… Constant crashes, dependency hell, and way too many of those crashes required re-imaging the disk bc they crashed so badly.<br>I’m seriously glad I didn’t waste the money to buy an 8gb pi4, which was released just weeks after I finally bought a 4gbI purposely waited as long as I did to get a pi4 bc I’ve been using them since the original b+ was released.<br>I know it takes a while to get all the bugs worked out with each new release.<br>I’ve done enough beta testing in my life and was under the impression that 64bit was working when I bought it, not that it was still a beta back then.<br>So it was a huge let down after spending all that money only to find out the apps I use weren’t gonna work with 64bit, which was the only reason I bought itHonestly I’m kinda sick of raspberry pi’s, they can be great little devices for many projects.<br>But for many projects people use them for, like the media server/NAS/etc I bought it for.<br>They are so not worth it! By the time you buy all the accessories, drives, hats, cords, etc, you may as well have gotten a cheap used desktop.<br>No rats nest of wires, you can actually stream HD and even to more than one device at a time in a wider range of formats.<br>Faster transfer rates on smb/nfs, a desktop could even be used as a desktop, which a pi is a horrible substitute for.<br>And that’s not even to mention that you just can’t buy them now, unless you’re able to pay greedy scalpers over inflated prices.<br>Covid inflation was bad enough to deal with, I’m not paying $100 for a $15 SOC…Loving your optimistic takes on so many diverse points in your detailed post.<br>It sounds like the Pi isn’t a great fit for you though.Is there a way to upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit without wiping out and starting again?Yes, it’s called “cross grading”.<br>But it can be very tricky to avoid all pitfalls.<br>See  for the details.So, crossgrading is possible, how about upgrading from lite to full.<br>I’ve  been playing with 64bit but have failed to get vnc working.<br>A full desktop version  might be better.Crossgrading doesn’t really work…
It seemed like it was working, but I can’t find a way to upgrade to the dpkg:arm64LEEETS GO is it possible to update without data wipe ?Yes it is *feasible* if one has the knowledge to deal with all the issues which this would cause, but in practical and sanity terms best to start afresh with a clean install.Is there anything in Raspberry Pi OS (or its repositories) that functions like Linux Mint’s “Backup Tool”? I’m just trying to figure out if there’s any program or application that would speed up the process of rebuilding my system (with all the programs I added, printer, scanner, config.txt tweaks, and so forth) to what it was before under the 32-bit system.<br>I try to keep a record/journal of all that I’ve done, but it would be nice not to have to re-do it all manually.<br>Esp.<br>since I have three pi that might benefit from this (400, 3B+, and 3B).dd command in every unix flavor OS (linux, macOs, all BSDs etc.)Hey Carl,
Not sure if you’d think this was overkill, but longer term you might be interested in exploring tools like Ansible, since you can make your setup repeatable via scripts.Of course, that doesn’t help you so much with recreating your existing setup, but maybe you can get some of the way using one or both of these:
1.<br>Use your bash history – I’d be tempted to copy it to a fresh file and then cut it down to the steps that were necessary and worked.<br>That can then be used to make a start with Ansible or if you want to defer that, just paste the commands that look relevent.<br>In some cases, eg with config changes to files, you won’t see what was changed from a command to open your editor, but at least you’ll know the files you may have updated so you can compare those.
2.<br>If you’re mainly focused on the packages, then you can use the sort of techniques shown here: 
but you’ll still potentially need to make config changes (so might combine with 1 above)Point 2 should be somewhat reliable even if you did configuration via gui tools, but point 1 is not going to pick up any gui based editing of config.I’d agree with Neil’s post about Ansible, all the simple stuff, automated,  all I do is boot once, logon, change the name, change the password, reboot.<br> Then ssh-copy-id from my Ansible control machine [another Pi, or any other flavour of Linux] and then run a nested set of commands which:
Fixes DNS resolution, sets the proxies, creates mount points, entries in fstab, sets PROMPT_COMMAND, sets the history file size, that sort of thing.<br> Takes about a minute to configure after rebooting.I’d suggest provisioning your systems with your custom Ansible playbook, works like a charm and saves a ton of time.My database uses much ram….<br>(Influxdb)My server running the 64Bit Beta for a while 🚜Finally! This is exciting news, and while I’m guessing (like with the libcamera change recently) it will cause a bit of short-term strife for some users (especially on older boards), this is a great long-term improvement so many users don’t have to spend as much time trying to get newer software working on ancient 32-bit architectures.Thanks for the tireless work getting Pi OS to be as transparent to run on Raspberry Pis as possible.<br>The efforts are often less appreciated, but go far in recommending Pis vs other SBCs.if this was just released today, why have the 64bit binaries on the download site say the last update is the 28th of January?Presumably just final QC after code freeze on 28/1, etc.<br>I remember the same question being asked re bullseye release date vs blog.Gordon & Team:  Thank you so much for all your hard work to bring the 64 bit version to release!As a macOs user used to 64 bit I immediately used spare SSD to install 64 bit raspberry pi os Lite and then via KIAUH script klipper and fluiddpi.<br>All went well and without any issues.<br>I will copy all my klipper configs to 64 bit os tomorrow and will see how it goes with my Ender 5 Plus with SKR 1.4 board.<br>Not that it worked bad previously, but heck, why not?I’ve been using the 64 bit beta of bullseye on my Pi4 8gb.<br>Should I just update or do a fresh install?According to an above post.<br> Apt update, apt upgrade gets you there.Thanks rclark.<br>I’ll do both and let the group know.According to the Official Documents it should be:
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgradeThe best feature of RPiOS ARM64 which is based of Debian Bullseye ARM64 (nothing to do with Raspbian whatsoever) is that Debian Backports are compatible.This is a great step.<br>One thing that was missing from the beta is Mathematica.<br>Is that back for this release? Thanks.No, currently that is available on the 32-bit OS.<br>Will ask about supporting 64-bitThanks.<br>I look very much forward to running that on the 64-bit OS.<br>For me, it really is the main reason to install the desktop version of RPiOS instead of the Lite version.Ummm so when I tried to install it I cannot use multiple desktops (It immediately goes into an inescapable brown screen), I think this is to do with the weird new window manager.<br>Can you please tell me how to use OpenBox and ignore using Mutter or whatever as it’s very annoying how the windows tear when you move them, as well as the desktop issue.<br>Please respond, as I would LOVE to uses 64bit but cannot under this weird problem.I am also already using 32bit Bullseye with no problem at all WITHOUT the Mutter window thing.I’ve been running the beta PI OS 64 since it became known.<br> It has been solid for my playing around on a RPI4 4GB.<br> Never crashed.<br>Of course I run it headless and just SSH in and SFTP to transfer files.<br>Currently it is running off a USB connected SSD.<br>Nice to see PI OS 64bit finally released officially.<br> I really don’t have a ‘need’ for 64bits other than using it to program in 64bit assembly for fun.<br> I think, for now, I’ll just run it on my RPI4s and CM4 modules.Coming from beta is an rpi-update recommended?Don’t forget that the later Raspberry Pi 2 (v1.2) uses the same CPU as the Raspberry Pi 3, only slightly downclocked.<br>There’s no reason the Pi 2 v1.2 shouldn’t be able to run the 64 bit version (download page doesn’t list it as compatible).
I’d test it, but all my 2s are v1.0, so the earlier chip listed above.Yes the version 1.2 does run ARM64 OSes, though I believe not many were sold and they utilise the original BCM2837 SoC.Wasmer on Pi let’s gooooorasp 4B not support yet?I very much hope that widevine’s problems will be resolved in the future.Contact Google who are the developers.Can we now install PIXEL on Ubuntu 64?
thnxPIXEL no longer exists so unlikely compatible with any post 2018 Operating System.Ok.<br>No chance to get same desktop environment on ubuntu or debian?
(I really like how it looks and useful on my home pasberry and looking a way to get the same on my vps)How do I install Mathematica on 64-bit Pi OS?Not yet; see my question above with answer by Gordon.<br>(Search the page for Mathematica, use Ctrl-F or Cmd-F.)Is it possible to install KODI without having to build it myself?Got a Zero 2 W that i wanted to use for KODI but Libreelec is still struggling to support this new hardware (problems with the wifi module i think).Have you triedsudo apt install kodiCongrats on the release.<br>Is wiringPi library compatible with it, i.e.<br>works? I loosely remember that its author has given up on maintaining it, not recognizing 8GB RPI 4B for example.I’m afraid I don’t know; we don’t support it (it’s nothing to do with us; it’s a third-party library).<br>I don’t think its original author is still maintaining it, so my guess is that no, it won’t work for you.raspberry 64  stable is very good , 1 speed boost 2.improve video PlaybackDo I need to format my SD card and download the 64-bit OS to it, or is there an upgrade path for a 4 from 32-bit?Yes you can update from 32to 64 but it is a long and winding road with many pitfalls, see the Forum as been discussed.Best grab a spare SD Card start afresh..Hello, it means that if I have a 64-bit version of Raspberry OS, I can download programs for Debian OHello, does this mean that if I have a 64-bit version of Raspberry OS, I can download programs for Debian OS 64-bit “for Arm64”?Raspberry Pi ARM64 Operating System is based of Debian Bullseye ARM64 Operating System.This sounds great! Any chance that we can get an updated version of the Raspberry Pi OS for Desktop computers? Maybe a 64bit version? I like to use mine as a live USB for projects on the go but a 64bit option for me would make it better on some devices.</p>

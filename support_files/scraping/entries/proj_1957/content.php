<p>Support 100 years of independent journalism.Seventy years after its publication, Theodor Adorno's Minima Moralia is a warning against resurgent fascismBy

Critical of all group loyalty and always distancing himself from his social surroundings, Adorno was a cosmopolitan intellectual who carried his erudition on his back as the only possession that

culture.<br>“The son of well-to-do parents who,” Adorno writes, “engages in so-called intellectual profession, as an artist or a scholar, will have a particularly difficult time with those bearing the distasteful title of colleagues.” In the “competitive hierarchy” of official culture he is seen as a “dilettante, no matter how well he knows his subject,” not least because he objects to the “departmentalisation of spirit”.<br>If he dares to think of himself as an “independent intellectual,” he is nonetheless exposed to the “practical” demands of the institutions he has left behind.<br>“[S]ome have to play the game because they cannot otherwise live, and those who could live otherwise are kept out because they do not want to play the game.”Adorno admired Proust but he was also describing himself.<br>Born in 1903 in Frankfurt into a middle-class family, Adorno was raised as an only child by parents whose boundless affection equipped him with an almost narcissistic

childhood.<br>No published work better conveys Adorno’s inimitable persona, his special gift for intermingling the sociological and the autobiographical, the nostalgic and the austere.<br>The genius of his writing is that he never permitted himself to rest completely in either domain.<br>Even at the highest pitch of philosophical abstraction he never unbinds himself from the social world, and

bourgeois 19th century placed at my cradle at the beginning of the 20th.” One of the later entries in is titled, “Regressions,” in which Adorno writes of his early memories of the “Cradle Song” by Brahms, a piece that he associated with the curtain around his childhood bed that shielded him from light so that he could sleep “in an unending peace without fear”.RelatedStill, Adorno always

metastasised into the modern state.<br>“In Fascism,” he concludes, “the nightmare of childhood has come true.”All of these memories spoke of displacement.<br>During his period of exile, first the few, lonely years as a student at Oxford University in the mid-1930s, then in the US where he kept close to the émigré community and looked upon most of American life with a mixture of alienation and

no longer possible.” Little in Adorno’s work better expresses his mistrust of “dwelling” and “authenticity”, those cherished themes of existentialism.<br>In 1941, after a few years in New York, Adorno followed his colleague, the philosopher and sociologist Max Horkheimer, out to Los Angeles County, where they lived not far from other artists and intellectuals, including Bertolt Brecht and the composer Arnold Schoenberg, all of them exiles from central Europe.The sunny Californian climate reminded him of Tuscany.<br>Still, is there anything more incongruous than the image of Adorno in Los

In the opening dedication to Max Horkheimer, Adorno writes that the book is meant as a contribution to what was once considered philosophy’s highest mission: “the teaching of the good life”.<br>But is such instruction still possible?  Adorno knew that with the professionalisation of philosophy this mission has suffered neglect.<br>To ask how we should live our lives only conceals the bitter truth that there is no longer anything substantive to human life at all.<br>We cannot pretend that people “still have the capacity to act as subjects” when in fact they are “no more than component parts of machinery”.<br>And yet Adorno did not wish to surrender his devotion to the good.<br>At the margins of capitalist society where the imperatives of production and exchange have still not wholly colonised consciousness we are still dimly aware that the world has gone hopelessly wrong.<br>Only if we sustain our opposition to the current order and its imperatives can we “bring about another [order] more worthy of human beings”.<br>Adorno had grown suspicious of grand theories.<br>Although he sustained a seldom-stated bond with Marxism he was not primarily interested in political economy, nor did he have any real talent for the topic.<br>Instead he was drawn to the inspection of lived experience in all of its exquisite detail.<br>The starting point for such an inquiry is the embattled subject whose individual experiences even in their decay might still contribute to knowledge.It is on this level of individual experience, always qualified by sociological knowledge, that Adorno sought the requisite sources of moral insight.<br>Despite the tones of hopelessness that pervade his book, Adorno remains attuned to the fleeting moments of individual happiness even in the midst of despair.<br>These moments are signs of the “non-identical”, traces in everyday life of the subject-in-exile who has not succumbed to the false social whole.<br>We should not be surprised to learn that Adorno once told his publisher that part three of was his favourite.<br>It is there that we find one of the book’s most affecting passages, “Toy shop”, in which Adorno gave free rein to his interpretative skills.It was also the entry that more than any other bears a resemblance to the ideas and methods of his friend Walter Benjamin, the German philosopher who had died by suicide only six years before at the age of 48, during his flight from fascism.<br>Benjamin too, was fascinated by children’s books and toys, and his memory hangs over Adorno’s writing like a melancholy muse.<br>Adorno reflects on the purposeless wonder of a child’s experience, and the disenchantment that sets in once capitalism imposes its demands.<br>When the imperative of “earning a living” colonises our life all of the aimless activities of childhood must be abandoned and the specificity of things is lost.<br>Hence the significance of child’s play.<br>“In his purposeless activity the child, by a subterfuge, sides with use-value against exchange value” and resists the demand that things should be valued only in exchange.<br>The child still knows what the adult has forgotten, that the things have value beyond their value as commodities, and when the child tends to this value “he seeks to rescue in them what is benign towards men”.<br>Under the sober gaze of the adult, children’s games may seem superficial, but it is capitalism that has robbed human life of its depth.<br>“The unreality of games gives notice that reality is not yet real.<br>Unconsciously they rehearse the right life.” And, because children are not yet fully tethered to the mechanisms of production and commodification that have disfigured our nature, they also retain an instinctive love for animals, whose very existence seems to beckon as an undisguised utopia.<br>“In existing without any purpose recognisable to men, animals hold out, as if for expression, their own names, utterly impossible to exchange.”To accuse Adorno of sentimentalism would be mistaken.<br>The task of is to assist us in seeing the redemptive surplus that lies unrealised at the interstices of everyday experience.<br>It does not draw back in horror from the totality of the world and condemn it all as false;

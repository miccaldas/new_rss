The book\u2019s subtitle, \u201cReflections from Damaged Life\u201d, is a record of this unhealed wound, a bitter confession that even to write about individual experience suggests a complicity with \u201cunspeakable collective events\u201d.

Critical of all group loyalty and always distancing himself from his social surroundings, Adorno was a cosmopolitan intellectual who carried his erudition on his back as the only possession that mattered. In the first aphorism of the book, Adorno offers a homage to Marcel Proust as an embodiment of European spirit who draws back in horror from the noise and ruin of what now passes for culture. \u201cThe son of well-to-do parents who,\u201d Adorno writes, \u201cengages in so-called intellectual profession, as an artist or a scholar, will have a particularly difficult time with those bearing the distasteful title of colleagues.\u201d In the \u201ccompetitive hierarchy\u201d of official culture he is seen as a \u201cdilettante, no matter how well he knows his subject,\u201d not least because he objects to the \u201cdepartmentalisation of spirit\u201d.

But is such instruction still possible?\u00a0 Adorno knew that with the professionalisation of philosophy this mission has suffered neglect. To ask how we should live our lives only conceals the bitter truth that there is no longer anything substantive to human life at all. We cannot pretend that people \u201cstill have the capacity to act as subjects\u201d when in fact they are \u201cno more than component parts of machinery\u201d. And yet Adorno did not wish to surrender his devotion to the good. At the margins of capitalist society where the imperatives of production and exchange have still not wholly colonised consciousness we are still dimly aware that the world has gone hopelessly wrong. Only if we sustain our opposition to the current order and its imperatives can we \u201cbring about another [order] more worthy of human beings\u201d. Adorno had grown suspicious of grand theories. Although he sustained a seldom-stated bond with Marxism he was not primarily interested in political economy, nor did he have any real talent for the topic. Instead he was drawn to the inspection of lived experience in all of its exquisite detail.

Benjamin too, was fascinated by children\u2019s books and toys, and his memory hangs over Adorno\u2019s writing like a melancholy muse. Adorno reflects on the purposeless wonder of a child\u2019s experience, and the disenchantment that sets in once capitalism imposes its demands. When the imperative of \u201cearning a living\u201d colonises our life all of the aimless activities of childhood must be abandoned and the specificity of things is lost. Hence the significance of child\u2019s play. \u201cIn his purposeless activity the child, by a subterfuge, sides with use-value against exchange value\u201d and resists the demand that things should be valued only in exchange. The child still knows what the adult has forgotten, that the things have value beyond their value as commodities, and when the child tends to this value \u201che seeks to rescue in them what is benign towards men\u201d. Under the sober gaze of the adult, children\u2019s games may seem superficial, but it is capitalism that has robbed human life of its depth. \u201cThe unreality of games gives notice that reality is not yet real. Unconsciously they rehearse the right life.\u201d And, because children are not yet fully tethered to the mechanisms of production and commodification that have disfigured our nature, they also retain an instinctive love for animals, whose very existence seems to beckon as an undisguised utopia. \u201cIn existing without any purpose recognisable to men, animals hold out, as if for expression, their own names, utterly impossible to exchange.\u201d", "images": []},

Critical of all group loyalty and always distancing himself from his social surroundings, Adorno was a cosmopolitan intellectual who carried his erudition on his back as the only possession that mattered.

But is such instruction still possible?\u00a0 Adorno knew that with the professionalisation of philosophy this mission has suffered neglect.

Only if we sustain our opposition to the current order and its imperatives can we \u201cbring about another [order] more worthy of human beings\u201d. Adorno had grown suspicious of grand theories. Although he sustained a seldom-stated bond with Marxism he was not primarily interested in political economy, nor did he have any real talent for the topic.

Benjamin too, was fascinated by children\u2019s books and toys, and his memory hangs over Adorno\u2019s writing like a melancholy muse. Adorno reflects on the purposeless wonder of a child\u2019s experience, and the disenchantment that sets in once capitalism imposes its demands. When the imperative of \u201cearning a living\u201d colonises our life all of the aimless activities of childhood must be abandoned and the specificity of things is lost. Hence the significance of child\u2019s play. \u201cIn his purposeless activity the child, by a subterfuge, sides with use-value against exchange value\u201d and resists the demand that things should be valued only in exchange. The child still knows what the adult has forgotten, that the things have value beyond their value as commodities, and when the child tends to this value \u201che seeks to rescue in them what is benign towards men\u201d. Under the sober gaze of the adult, children\u2019s games may seem superficial, but it is capitalism that has robbed human life of its depth. \u201cThe unreality of games gives notice that reality is not yet real. Unconsciously they rehearse the right life.\u201d And, because children are not yet fully tethered to the mechanisms of production and commodification that have disfigured our nature, they also retain an instinctive love for animals, whose very existence seems to beckon as an undisguised utopia. \u201cIn existing without any purpose recognisable to men, animals hold out, as if for expression, their own names, utterly impossible to exchange.\u201d", "images": []},

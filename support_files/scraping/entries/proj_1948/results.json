Can the sequential accumulation of small random changes, each beneficial on its own, lead within the timespan available to the evolution of such astonishingly complex and impressive adaptations as we see around us in nature, such as eyes, brains or wings, where complementary parts interweave into a complex whole? However, the only alternative at the fundamental level conceived of up until now consisted of variants of Lamarckism\u2014the idea that organisms can somehow respond directly to their immediate environments with beneficial genetic change.

However, the only alternative at the fundamental level conceived of up until now consisted of variants of Lamarckism\u2014the idea that organisms can somehow respond directly to their immediate environments with beneficial genetic change.

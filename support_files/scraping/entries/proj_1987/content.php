<p>Hi! This is Kris from Albera.<br>We're a research engine created pretty much with the idea of saving users a bunch of time and effort when looking for knowledge online.Using AI, Albera provides context about your chosen topic in the form of knowledge "trees" (similar to what you're seeing in the gif).<br>These trees are populated with relevant subtopics ("branches" and "leaves"), laid out in a simple-to-complex order (as determined by the AI) for a structured learning experience.We then get crawlers to scour the web for learning-oriented articles and videos, and do away with redundant stuff and marketing content; that way most of the material you'll need can easily be found in your "garden."The platform's pretty new, so we're looking to get some users in to try it out and hopefully give feedback (and also to help train the AI further).<br>If you're interested, you may create an account  - we're giving out free subscriptions for the first 1,000 sign-ups.<br>Thanks!This actually looks really cool.<br>I'll let someone who will get more use from it take one of the 1000 spots.<br>Good luck!Looks awesome! I'll give it a tryThanks I will give this a tryThis is awesome! Will help a lot in my research.Do you have plans on offering plans for institutions, like universities, so they can pay for all students and professors?I'm only curious about the crawler used.<br>are you using someone elses crawler or do you have one of your own?MembersOnlineHi!

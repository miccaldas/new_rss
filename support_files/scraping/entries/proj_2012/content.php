<p>Ελευθερία ή Θάνατος! (Freedom or Death)Easily the most badass national motto.<br>Close second is the Swiss "One for all and all for one" and the Chilean "Through reason or through force"It's same with the Turkish motto "Ya istiklâl ya ölum".A special thanks to France, UK and Russia for their assistance and support.You should be more grateful to Admiral Codrington than Britain.<br>He was considered at the time to have acted without orders.I'm always glad for Greece.Serbia on the other hand , established a de facto independent state, but was supported by no one (even Russia left us in 1812), and Napoleon even sent cannons to help the Ottomans.The French, the British and Austria made sure Serbia wouldn't gain formal independence all the way up to 1878 and the Congress of Berlin.Always a fan of Greece I am.<br>But it helps being the teacher's pet.Didn’t the celebrate 200 years last year 🤔 I’m confused 😅Happy Anniversary Greece 🥳❤️And the war rages on in  once you mention Thrace or Cyprus...Megali idea was best V2 campaign other than Krakow though.Merci, mon ami!The amount of butthurtism of some (neighboring) redditors on this thread makes me want to celebrate this day even though I was totally unaware that the anniversary was today lollol just wanted to share thisΖήτω η Ελλάς!"Get down here Yiorgos, stop this flag nonsense and help, there are people shooting us"MembersOnline</p>

<p>Google, Amazon, and the entire tracking industry relies on IAB Europe’s consent system, which has now been found to be illegal following complaints coordinated by ICCL.  In a decision of 2 February 2022, 28 EU data protection authorities, led by the Belgian Data Protection Authority as the leading supervisory authority in the GDPR’s one-stop-mechanism, found that the online advertising industry’s trade body “IAB Europe”  commits multiple violations of the GDPR in its processing of personal data in the context of its “Transparency and Consent Framework” (TCF) and the realtime bidding system OpenRTB.The consent popup system known as the “Transparency & Consent Framework” (TCF) is on 80% of the European internet.<br>The tracking industry claimed it was a measure to comply with the GDPR.<br>Today, GDPR enforcers ruled that this consent spam has, in fact, deprived hundreds of millions of Europeans of their fundamental rights.The TCF consent system infringes the GDPR in the following ways:The Belgian Data Protection Authority said IAB Europe “was aware of risks linked to non-compliance” and “was negligent”.<br>It also found that IAB Europe had failed to honour its data protection obligations to maintain records of data processing (Article 30 GDPR), to conduct a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) (Article 35 GDPR), and to appoint a Data Protection Officer (Article 37 GDPR).Citing the TCF’s “systematic deficiencies”, the Belgian Data Protection Authority noted that it “supports a system posing great risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subjects, in particular in view of the large scale of personal data involved, the profiling activities, the prediction of behaviour, and the ensuing surveillance of data subjects.”All data collected through the TCF must now be deleted by the more than 1,000 companies that pay IAB Europe to use the TCF.<br>This includes Google’s, Amazon’s and Microsoft’s online advertising businesses.These findings are the result of proceedings initiated by complainants at the Belgian Data Protection Authority, coordinated by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.<br>The group of complainants includes: Dr Johnny Ryan of the , Katarzyna Szymielewicz of the  (Poland),  (the Netherlands),  (Belgium), , and .<br>The Belgian procedure follows complaints about the insecurity of the online advertising “Real-Time Bidding” (RTB) system that Dr Ryan initiated in 2018.The decision was made by the Belgian Data Protection Authority in agreement with 27 other EU data protection authorities, and is immediately binding and enforceable across the European Union under the GDPR’ “one stop shop” mechanism.“This has been a long battle”, said Dr Johnny Ryan of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.<br>“Today’s decision frees hundreds of millions of Europeans from consent spam, and the deeper hazard that their most intimate online activities will be passed around by thousands of companies”.We wish to thank our lawyers, Frederic Debusseré and Ruben Roex of Timelex.We are reading the decision in detail, and will publish our more detailed analysis at a later point.Full decision

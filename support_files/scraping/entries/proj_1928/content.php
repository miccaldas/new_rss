<p>WASHINGTON, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A flaw in Apple's software  to break into iPhones in 2021 was simultaneously abused by a competing company, according to five people familiar with the matter.QuaDream, the sources said, is a smaller and lower profile Israeli firm that also develops smartphone hacking tools intended for government clients.The two rival businesses gained the same ability last year to remotely break into iPhones, according to the five sources, meaning that both firms could compromise Apple phones without an owner needing to open a malicious link.<br>That two firms employed the same sophisticated hacking technique – known as a “zero-click” – shows that phones are more vulnerable to powerful digital spying tools than the industry will admit, one expert said."People want to believe they're secure, and phone companies want you to believe they're secure.<br>What we've learned is, they're not," said Dave Aitel, a partner at Cordyceps Systems, a cybersecurity firm.Experts analyzing intrusions engineered by NSO Group and QuaDream since last year believe the two companies used very similar software exploits, known as , to hijack iPhones.An exploit is computer code designed to leverage a set of specific software vulnerabilities, giving a hacker unauthorized access to data.The analysts believed NSO and QuaDream's exploits were similar because they leveraged many of the same vulnerabilities hidden deep inside Apple's instant messaging platform and used a comparable approach to plant malicious software on targeted devices, according to three of the sources.Bill Marczak, a security researcher with digital watchdog Citizen Lab who has been studying both companies' hacking tools, told Reuters that QuaDream's zero-click capability seemed "on par" with NSO's.Reuters made repeated attempts to reach QuaDream for comment, sending messages to executives and business partners.<br>A Reuters journalist last week visited QuaDream’s office, in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, but no one answered the door.<br>Israeli lawyer Vibeke Dank, whose email was listed on QuaDream's corporate registration form, also did not return repeated messages.An Apple spokesman declined to comment on QuaDream or say what if any action they planned to take with regard to the company.ForcedEntry is viewed as  ever captured by security researchers.So similar were the two versions of ForcedEntry that when Apple fixed the underlying flaws in September 2021 it rendered both NSO and QuaDream’s spy software ineffective, according to two people familiar with the matter.In a written statement, an NSO spokeswoman said the company "did not cooperate" with QuaDream but that "the cyber intelligence industry continues to grow rapidly globally."Apple  NSO Group over ForcedEntry in November, claiming that NSO had violated Apple's user terms and services agreement.<br>The case is still in its early stages.In its lawsuit, Apple said that it "continuously and successfully fends off a variety of hacking attempts."

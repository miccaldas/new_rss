Well, it didn't take too long to figure out that by setting the memory start addresses appropriately, and by using the attribute mode, you could essentially set up a Spectrum screen (so much for 256 colors)! There were slight differences in the format of the attributes (as I recall, they used 4/4 bits for paper and ink, with no flashing attribute bit) but other than that the screen layout was the same. Once this was accomplished (and with a little help from George Barns, who figured out how to interpret the documentation relating to making a change of screen mode stick!) the rest was plain sailing. The Enterprise had some nice features, like the ability to load a program from any input stream (not just tape).

One feature allowed you to set the start memory address of each scanline; another feature allowed color attributes to be specified, corresponding to 8x8 pixel areas of the screen. Well, it didn't take too long to figure out that by setting the memory start addresses appropriately, and by using the attribute mode, you could essentially set up a Spectrum screen (so much for 256 colors)! There were slight differences in the format of the attributes (as I recall, they used 4/4 bits for paper and ink, with no flashing attribute bit) but other than that the screen layout was the same. Once this was accomplished (and with a little help from George Barns, who figured out how to interpret the documentation relating to making a change of screen mode stick!) the rest was plain sailing. The Enterprise had some nice features, like the ability to load a program from any input stream (not just tape). This made it possible to fabricate a suitable header over a serial port and download directly from the BBC Micro development machines into the Enterprise.

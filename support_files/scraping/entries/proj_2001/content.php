Or, at a minimum, XFree86/GNU/Linux? Of course, it would be rather arbitrary to draw the line there when many other fine contributions go unlisted.<br>Yes, I know you've heard this one before.<br>Get used to it.<br>You'll keep hearing it until you can cleanly counter it.You seem to like the lines-of-code metric.<br>There are many lines of GNU code in a typical Linux distribution.<br>You seem to suggest that (more LOC) == (more important).<br>However, I submit to you that raw LOC numbers do not directly correlate with importance.<br>I would suggest that clock cycles spent on code is a better metric.<br>For example, if my system spends 90% of its time executing XFree86 code, XFree86 is probably the single most important collection of code on my system.<br>Even if I loaded ten times as many lines of useless bloatware on my system and I never excuted that bloatware, it certainly isn't more important code than XFree86.<br>Obviously, this metric isn't perfect either, but LOC really, really sucks.<br>Please refrain from using it ever again in supporting any argument.Last, I'd like to point out that we Linux and GNU users shouldn't be fighting among ourselves over naming other people's software.<br>But what the heck, I'm in a bad mood now.<br>I think I'm feeling sufficiently obnoxious to make the point that GCC is so very famous and, yes, so very useful only because Linux was developed.<br>In a show of proper respect and gratitude, shouldn't you and everyone refer to GCC as 'the Linux compiler'? Or at least, 'Linux GCC'? Seriously, where would your masterpiece be without Linux? Languishing with the HURD?If there is a moral buried in this rant, maybe it is this:Be grateful for your abilities and your incredible success and your considerable fame.<br>Continue to use that success and fame for good, not evil.<br>Also, be especially grateful for Linux' huge contribution to that success.<br>You, RMS, the Free Software Foundation, and GNU software have reached their current high profiles largely on the back of Linux.<br>You have changed the world.<br>Now, go forth and don't be a nag.I briefly ran a version of Trisquel in college.<br>I didn't have working wifi and the OS never told me like "hey the reason your wifi doesn't work is it required proprietary firmware, consider swapping out the card for such and such or get such and such USB dongle" - like I get the idea they're going for, but to not provide any alternatives and assume people are just going to figure it out is kind of unintuitive.Doesn't desktop in general Linux presume a certain amount of CLI voodoo on the operator side?Former user of Trisquel here (now using Debian Stable).It's actually a reasonably good distribution and has/had a good community behind it when I frequented the forums.<br>Granted, I was already pretty "free software" aware and had a compatible Atheros Wi-Fi card.Good to see they moved to MATE Desktop - they were using  mode before which was quite buggy.The biggest issue I can see with the project is that Trisquel does lag behind Ubuntu by quite a bit (Trisquel 10 is based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS), just as the next Ubuntu LTS is coming out.<br>This means most of the current Trisquel users are still essentially on Ubuntu 18.04.<br>I believe there is some effort to make backports available to make it more usable for people who need individual packages that are more recent (e.g.<br>LibreOffice).I'm not overly familiar with the amount of work needed to clean, repackage and retheme Ubuntu as a Trisquel release.<br>Sometimes I wonder if it would be feasible for Trisquel to track the STS releases without producing a release, so that they can get a release of the LTS out sooner.I do have a great deal of respect for Rubén, Jason and various others who are involved in the project and understand that any small project has its limits!If, according to , Linux is just the kernel, why do they refer to the kernel in the release announcement as ?Because that's the GNU Libre fork of the kernel? It doesn't have any blobs in itNotify the only user: Stallman Please don't crucify me trisquel is coolI recently switched to Trisquel with GNOME on my daily-driver laptop after briefly trying it out on one of my other machines.<br>I had to swap the wifi card out for one that could be used with exclusively Free software, but these things cost less than 10 Republic Credits on eBay, so it was totally worth it for me.<br>I  like it.So now there's  two Triquel users in the world, thank you very much.MembersOnline</p>

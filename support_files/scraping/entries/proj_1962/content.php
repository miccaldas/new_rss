<p>Written in Haskell with .GitHub - Nice job!One thing - I read that “irate” is supposed to be a good starter word but when I play it I’m told that it’s not a valid word? A limitation of the word dictionary perhaps?Thank you for your feedback!Yes, I also noticed that using single dictionary for both target word and guesses it not comfortable.<br>I’m thinking of using 10k dictionary for targets and 84k for guesses.<br>This way it’s less limiting for guessesuse  instead..<br>good followup word is Awesome.<br>Good jobThank you!clown blown and many other words are invalid?Yes, that's because it uses 10k word dictionary by default.<br>I fill fix this as part of this .very cool.<br>how do I get it working on macOS with zsh? I get  when I try to run it.Binary is compiled for x86-64, so you have to compile it yourself.<br>Follow “install from source” in the readme.Looks like grape is not in 10k of most common words :D To be fixed, thanks for the feedback.You could even pull the "official" list of answers from the original so that you could play the same game as everyone else.<br>It's just hardcoded into the javascript.<br>Would it be possible to provide the emoji representation so I can post it on my socials, otherwise what's the whole point :)Actual goal was to make a game that is not limited to one word a day...<br>and that lives in the terminal :)I’m open for feature suggestions, so recreating official daily challenge with result sharing sounds like a really nice feature.<br>I appreciate your feedback!Everyone interested in the project development consider watching/starring its GitHub repository.<br>Suggestions and contributions are always welcome.I like it!!!Author of Brick here, very cool project!

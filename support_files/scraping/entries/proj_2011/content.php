<p>Is Rennes really doing that well? Honest question, when I hear of French Business it's always Paris (sometimes Toulouse/ Nantes/ Lyon/ Bordeaux/ Grenoble).Rennes is specialized in communications, a few high tech companies like Thales or the DGA have communication specialized subsidiaries in RennesRennes has a lot of tech companies (relative to its size), historically it is a telecom hub (that's where cellular networks were invented for example).<br>Those companies are not very famous because they work on network infrastructure rather than consumer application though.<br>Also lot of students and research.They are growing but it’s still smaller than many other citiesWhat is a superstar hub?"46 superstar hubs, which have an array of high-growth industries and have been among the fastest-growing regions in Europe.<br>...<br>Superstar hubs were the main magnets for new arrivals from 2011 to 2018, adding about two million people.."Would have helped if it actually used  for Sweden instead of counties, which, arguably, are too big for this kind of analysis.Also, who flooded the northern part of Stockholm County?StockholmLol yeah, according to this map, I live in the ocean.I think Öresund would like to speak with the map maker as well.TIL I live in a "Superstar hub".<br>Also, the UK looking surprisingly good here.The map is hard to read.<br>Something like this would be best if interactive and zoomable.Vast tracts of the UK are labelled as "service", including rural areas like Devon, Somerset, Shropshire and a lot of Norfolk.<br>I wouldn't mind knowing what the criteria were for how the labels are applied.Most of these things i dont understand.<br>Wtf is a "superstar hub"? Is a megacity better than a superstar hub?As far as i understood it its divided into 3 sectors, which are further divided into more specific ones.Dynamic growth hubs - goodStable economies - okayShrinking regions - badThen what could this map be used for? For investment strategies? Meaning they would invest in already wealthy regions, so the disparity would be even biggerI think those are Oxford and Cambridge driven, so I think one challenge for the Uk is to allow those areas to grow and the biggest challenge to that is to provide the housing and other infrastructure they need.<br>I feel for the Uk to progress plenty of housing is needed in those areas and isn’t currently provided.One other thing about the uk is there is no region that is high tech manufacturing dominated, which id guess is things like cars, advanced machinery, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors etc.<br>I think this should be an area of focus, but it’s very globally competitive and the uk is playing catch up so hard to grow in.And Spain seems to be surprisingly...<br>Bad? Is Barcelona really just a tourism haven? Is most of Spain really underdeveloped? (which is where this seems to be taken from)?Where is that map from? Chemnitz, where I live is definitely not service centered, it’s centered around production.It also is not exactly a dynamic growth hub, but McKinsey will sell you that.Sweden's shaft is agingMembersOnlineIs Rennes really doing that well?

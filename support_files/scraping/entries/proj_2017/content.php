<p>I love that the map uses dollars.<br>If only there was a currency used through a large part of Europe...If Europe used a currency shared with several countries I bet they would call it some obvious name like "Euros" or something.It's so Americans can see and feel bad.Typically statistics are reported in USD because that’s the way the OECD, IMF, and World Bank does.<br>The dollar is the most used currency for transactions and the reserve currency bar none.<br>Also, Poland, Hungary, and others don’t use the Euro.Scandinavia be like, f**k minimum wage, let the unions fight for that.Hey! Its working.Pretty much.<br>Or as seen from the other side of the coin, we don't need it since the unions have fought hard for livable wages.<br>I think our social welfare systems also play an important part, since it makes people less likely to accept slave wages just for the sake of survival.The unions live by “fuck around and find out” and I absolutely love it!A full time cashier in the biggest supermarket chain gets 19.388 kr.<br>per month or 2941,72 USD.<br>In Denmark.<br>Source fightMore like, "negotiate".<br>Big corporations love the unions becuase of the "understanding" relationship they have.<br>I know of employees of big corp.<br>with salary increase exactly on point with inflation no less no more.Edit: best part is, when questioning why they are not negotiating for themselves since they arent member of the union.<br>The answer was, "well we have made an agreement with the union "Also Finland.What does than mean for a given worker.If I go work for a company in Scandinavia with no prior skill or experience, what minimal wage do I get?Cry’s in Italian.We actually have very much minimun wage which does not support you if you have a family.<br>But we are not part of Scandinavia but still.italy too, except unions don't anymore.<br>they just care about pensions now.<br>Italy is brokenMembersOnline</p>

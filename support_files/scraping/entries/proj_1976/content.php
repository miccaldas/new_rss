<p>I'm doing multi-species alignments of many sequences per species.<br>I need to insert the species ID in the FASTA headers before aligning, so for example the headerI need to bewhere there is a 6-letter species ID followed by an underscore inserted directly after the '>' character.<br>I have ~60 files (1 per species), and I'm trying to write a script that would execute this on all matching files so I could reuse it.<br>It would be all the same species for each file, I'm just not sure how to write some bash code that would find the right species, insert the ID at the right place and then save a new file.<br>What I have right now is:Where "species_abbreviations" is a file I made with a list of all species IDs, e.g.<br>:allMisanoAplanoCaranoFreaspMaretc., And the file names are:allMis.L1.faanoApl.L1.faetc.<br>I'm struggling with finding a way to match the species ID with the first 6 letters of each file, then directing it to edit the headers.I think you want to just do a small tweak on your exampleIf the header is only on the first line and there are other ">" lines you don't want to modify, you might prefix it with "1" to limit the changeit worked, thank you!!!MembersOnlineI'm doing multi-species alignments of many sequences per species.<br>I need to insert the species ID in the FASTA headers before aligning, so for example the headerI need to bewhere there is a 6-letter species ID followed by an underscore inserted directly after the '>' character.<br>I have ~60 files (1 per species), and I'm trying to write a script that would execute this on all matching files so I could reuse it.<br>It would be all the same species for each file, I'm just not sure how to write some bash code that would find the right species, insert the ID at the right place and then save a new file.<br>What I have right now is:Where "species_abbreviations" is a file I made with a list of all species IDs, e.g.<br>:allMisanoAplanoCaranoFreaspMaretc., And the file names are:allMis.L1.faanoApl.L1.faetc.<br>I'm struggling with finding a way to match the species ID with the first 6 letters of each file, then directing it to edit the headers.I think you want to just do a small tweak on your exampleIf the header is only on the first line and there are other ">" lines you don't want to modify, you might prefix it with "1" to limit the changeit worked, thank you!!!MembersOnline</p>

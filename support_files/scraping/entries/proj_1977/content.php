<p>I like this almost.<br>I think it does too many things.<br>For example the bar thing should have been a separate application called prettybar or something or something like rich-echo that does the bar, panel, justify, ...<br>all those things.<br>The same with JSON and Markdown.Also if i wanted to use it as a nicer cat command and wanted to pretty print JSON and Markdown every time, I would have to make some other app that will launch rich with different arguments depending on a file extension.<br>That would be fine with me.<br>But the it just subjectively feels wrong to use another app just to tinker with arguments of a single app.<br>Now if it was split up (as I think it should be) it would feel ok.<br>Tho I understand there is basically no difference in performance in this particular use case so the feeling is irrational.<br>But it is there nontheless.?exactly what I was going to say I just use pandoc and lynx and an alias.could you share?
